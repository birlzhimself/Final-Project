# **Work Plan**

## **How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**

By collaboratively reviewing the summary and constructing a network topology of the necessary components, we can systematically determine the tasks that require attention. Subsequently, leveraging our recognized strengths, we can allocate these tasks while considering input from all team members. The completion of tasks will be marked by a team member finishing a given assignment, followed by validation from other members to ensure its alignment with project requirements and its seamless functionality.

## **What project management tool will be used?**

GitHub, link for our project will be: <https://github.com/birlzhimself/Final-Project>

A private channel/group was created in Slack and Discord in order to communicate and update every idea or improvements about the project. In fact, the schedules of each one of the elements of the group are quite different, but we already talked and everyday weâ€™re going to give feedback and try to ensure that all the work is done with all the presence of all the elements.

We will make sure that everyone is on board with every step of the project, having either worked on it or at least understood what was done by the other colleague every time there is a github commit or a decision was taken.
